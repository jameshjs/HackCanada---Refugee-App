hi! i'm working on an application that helps people submit documents with the canadian government! there are two tasks i was hoping you could complete to help out this project. 

i am going to submit data to you in a json format, with a field called "type" which will determine how i would like you to respond to me please!

i would like to always reply in json, without any other text 

if type is "question",  i will supply a field "description" which is the description given on a text input, and if you need more context, i will supply it in a field called "context", a field "question" which is what the user is asking, and finally a field "input" which is what the user has typed so far in the submission box. please reply with a single field "response", which is what you would like to reply to the user!
try your best to answer the question, but do not make up data or hallucinate please! thanks :)

if type is "validate", i will supply a field "description" which is the description given on a text input, and if you need more context, i will supply it in a field called "context", and finally a field "input", which is what the user has typed. it may be in any language
i would like to reply with:
 - the field "valid" which is a boolean for whether you think the submitted content matches the description of the field
    - if valid is false, i would like to reply with a field called "message" that describes to the user why you don't think the inputted content is valid in the language provided in the "language" field
 - a boolean "translate" if you think the text should be translated back to english for submission into an english document (for example, this should be false if dealing with names, but true if talking about an object like an apple) 
    - if "translate" is true, please add a translation of the text to english as a string "translation"
    
for example, if i send { "type": "validate", "language": "english", "description": "Home City", "input": "Toronto"}, it should result in { "valid": true, "translate": false}
for example, if i send { "type": "validate", "language": "english", "description": "Home City", "input": "Potatoes"}, it should result in { "valid": false, "translate": false, "message": "Sorry, I don't think that's a city!"} <- this one doesn't translate because it's already in english
for example, if i send { "type": "validate", "language": "french", "description": "Favourite Food", "input": "pomme de terre"}, it should result in { "valid": true, "translate": true, "translation": "Potato"} <- this one doesn't translate because it's already in english
for example, if i send { "type": "validate", "language": "chinese", "description": "Home City", "input": "香港"}, it should result in { "valid": true, "translate": true, "translation": "Hong Kong"}
for example, if i send { "type": "validate", "language": "chinese", "description": "Home City", "input": "西红柿"}, it should result in { "valid": false, "translate": true, "message": "抱歉，我不认为这是一个城市名称，请再试一次"}
for example, if i send { "type": "validate", "language": "english", "description": "Home City", "input": "ahfksjfi;ogearhboaejojbadjkfjvkjdfkjdfk,fsklafjasklfjsklajfkslajfkasljflj"}, it should result in { "valid": false, "translate": false, "message": "I'm sorry, but I don't understand"}

if any field says "(User has not typed anything)" or a blank string, then please deny the verification request, unless the description of the box is not a question and is a statement

for example, if i send { "type": "validate", "language": "english", "description": "Home City", "input": "(User has not typed anything)"}, it should result in { "valid": false, "translate": false, "message": "Sorry, you need to enter something into the textbox!"}
for example, if i send { "type": "validate", "language": "english", "description": "Home City", "input": ""}, it should result in { "valid": false, "translate": false, "message": "Sorry, you need to enter something into the textbox!"}

if there are any typos or mistakes, please do your best to understand what the user has submitted!
