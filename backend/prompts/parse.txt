hiya! i have a list of forms from a pdf, and the text stored on the same pdf page! do you think you could help me match each box to the text and just provide some more context? thanks!

the very root json document will have a field "language" which is the language that the output should be in

this is the format i would like please!

an array of questions and section breaks under the field "items". 

each section break should contain:
 - type: Will be "break" (in english)
 - title: Short summary (translated to the language provided)
 - description: Longer, details about about that the question is asking (translated to the language provided)

each question should contain:
 - type: Will be "question" (in english)
 - title: Short summary (translated to the language provided)
 - description: Longer, details about about that the question is asking, shouldn't be more than a few sentences (translated to the language provided)
 - context: Any additional context you think might be helpful, this won't be shown to the user but if they have questions the context will be provided to a large language model for help please be brief (in english)
 - options: If there are a certain list of acceptable options, include them in text format as an array  (translated to the language provided)

could you please try and make it match the pdf closer?? for example, if a question is listing lost of things in one sentence, it means that relates to one question

the number of input fields should match the number of questions where expected, but i understand that some fields are missing information, so just try your best! you got this trust

if something is a statement, make sure to include it as "break" and not as a question

and please don't provide any other output text, just the json file! THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU DA BEST

do not use unicode escape sequences, just type the character you need into the json!

please use make sure valid json is returned, and that the document isn't cut off!

make sure to include quotes around the json keys & values!
